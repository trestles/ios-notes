START OF MIRRORING OF THIS - ANOTHER CHANGE

## What is MVC?

## Events
  - traditionally, events are created and captured at the level of UIViewController
     - can be be created in Storyboard or in code
     - in Storyboard, would need to drag from item to UIViewController
        - does NOT need to have IBAction public interface
     - 
  - selectors
     - example of repeatedly calling selector in IA
     - registering a selector
     - simplest selector example   


UIImage - iOS7 doesn't run on single pixels iPhones but does run on single pixel iPads
